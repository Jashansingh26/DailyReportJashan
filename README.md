# DAY 3 :
We started day 3 by revising some important terms and topics of previous two days which are as follows :
 # üñ•Ô∏è Dual Boot
 - Dual booting allows a computer to run two different operating systems (OSes) on the same machine.

- Upon startup, users can choose which OS to boot into.

- Common setups include Windows/Linux .

# üìÄ ISO File
- An ISO file is a disk image that contains the complete contents of a CD, DVD, or other optical media

- These are commonly used to distribute Linux distributions and other bootable software.

# üß± Bare Metal Installation
- A bare metal installation involves installing an operating system directly onto a computer‚Äôs hardware, without any virtual box .

- This is typically used for full hardware access.

# üíº VMware
- VMware is a commercial virtualization platform known for its robust, enterprise-level features.

- It offer strong performance, and professional support, making it ideal for production environments.

# üîß VirtualBox
- VirtualBox is a free and open-source virtualization tool developed by Oracle.
 
- Best suited for personal use, development, and testing.

# üóÇÔ∏è Partitioning Schemes
- Partitioning involves dividing a hard disk into multiple sections, called partitions.

- Each partition can house a separate file system or OS.

Common schemes include:

- MBR (Master Boot Record) ‚Äì older, supports up to 4 primary partitions, use bios .

- GPT (GUID Partition Table) ‚Äì newer, supports more partitions and is compatible with UEFI systems.

# üîê File and Directory Permissions in Linux
- Linux uses a permission model to control who can read, write, or execute files and directories.
- 
- *chmod* - chmod stands for "change mode", and it's a command used in Unix/Linux systems to set or modify the permissions of a file or directory.
- Syntax - chmod [who][operator][permission] [file]
Components:
Who:

u = user (owner)

g = group

o = others

a = all (u+g+o)

Operator:

+ = add permission

- = remove permission

= = set exact permission

Permission:

r = read

w = write

x = execute
