# DAY 3️⃣ :
We started day 3 by revising some important terms and topics of previous two days which are as follows :
 # 🖥️ Dual Boot
 - Dual booting allows a computer to run two different operating systems (OSes) on the same machine.

- Upon startup, users can choose which OS to boot into.

- Common setups include Windows/Linux .

# 📀 ISO File
- An ISO file is a disk image that contains the complete contents of a CD, DVD, or other optical media

- These are commonly used to distribute Linux distributions and other bootable software.

# 🧱 Bare Metal Installation
- A bare metal installation involves installing an operating system directly onto a computer’s hardware, without any virtual box .

- This is typically used for full hardware access.

# 💼 VMware
- VMware is a commercial virtualization platform known for its robust, enterprise-level features.

- It offer strong performance, and professional support, making it ideal for production environments.

# 🔧 VirtualBox
- VirtualBox is a free and open-source virtualization tool developed by Oracle.
 
- Best suited for personal use, development, and testing.

# 🗂️ Partitioning Schemes
- Partitioning involves dividing a hard disk into multiple sections, called partitions.

- Each partition can house a separate file system or OS.

Common schemes include:

- MBR (Master Boot Record) – older, supports up to 4 primary partitions, use bios .

- GPT (GUID Partition Table) – newer, supports more partitions and is compatible with UEFI systems.

# 🔐 File and Directory Permissions in Linux
- Linux uses a permission model to control who can read, write, or execute files and directories.
- 
- *chmod* - chmod stands for "change mode", and it's a command used in Unix/Linux systems to set or modify the permissions of a file or directory.
- Syntax - chmod [who][operator][permission] [file]
- 
Components:
- Who:

u = user (owner)

g = group

o = others

a = all (u+g+o)

- Operator:

+ = add permission

- = remove permission

= = set exact permission

- Permission:

r = read

w = write

x = execute

# Redirection in Linux
Redirection in Linux means sending the input or output of a command to a file or another command, instead of the default input/output (usually the terminal).

📤 Output Redirection
| Type	| Symbol	| Example	| Description |
|------|--------|---------|-------------|
| Output	| >	| echo "Hello" > file.txt	| Writes "Hello" to file.txt (overwrites it) |
| Append	| >>	| echo "World" >> file.txt	| Appends "World" to the end of file.txt |

📥 Input Redirection
| Type	| Symbol	| Example	| Description |
|------|--------|---------|-------------|
| Input |	<	| wc -l < file.txt	| Reads file.txt as input to wc -l |

# 🔗 Pipes in Linux (|)
A pipe takes the output of one command and sends it as input to another command.

- Syntax
 
command1 | command2
command1 → generates output

command2 → uses that output as its input

- Example:
 
ls | sort
ls lists files

sort sorts the file names alphabetically

So, this command lists and sorts the files in the current directory.

# PRACTICE PROGRAMS

## Day 7: Networking Basics
# 🖧 Networking Concepts

## 🔌 Network
A **network** is a group of two or more interconnected computer systems that share data and resources through communication channels.

---

## 🖥️ Host
A **host** is any network-connected device assigned with an IP address, allowing it to participate in communication over a network.

---

## 🗄️ Server
A **server** is a powerful host machine that runs server software and responds to client requests—such as hosting websites, storing files, or managing emails.

---

## 👤 Client
In a **client-server** network, the client refers to the device or software that initiates requests and interacts with the user.

---

## 📶 Traffic
**Network traffic** refers to the flow of data packets across a network. It includes all communication types such as:

- Browsing
- File transfers
- Video streaming
- Emails
- And more

---

# 🌐 IP Address

### Full Form
**Internet Protocol**, a set of rules governing data transmission over networks.

### Properties
- **Unique:** Each device has a unique IP.
- **Universal:** Globally accepted for identification and communication.

### Types
- **Public IP:** Routable on the internet; globally unique.
- **Private IP:** Used within private networks (home/school); not routable on the internet.

### Dynamic Nature
IP addresses can change (dynamic assignment), but the core concepts of **uniqueness** and **universality** remain.

---

## 🔢 IPv4 – Internet Protocol Version 4

An IPv4 address is a 32-bit number divided into four 8-bit sections called **octets**, written in dot-decimal notation.

### Format
Example: `185.107.80.231`

Each octet ranges from 0 to 255 and is written in decimal for readability

---

## 🆕 IPv6 – Internet Protocol Version 6

IPv6 was introduced to overcome IPv4 address exhaustion. It uses **128-bit** addresses, written in **hexadecimal** and separated by colons `:`.

### Format
- 8 groups
- Each group = 16 bits = 2 bytes
- Each hex digit = 4 bits
- Example: `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`

---

## 🏷️ IP Address Classes

| Class | Range                  | Default Subnet Mask     | Used For         |
|-------|------------------------|--------------------------|------------------|
| A     | 1.0.0.0 – 126.0.0.0    | 255.0.0.0                | Large networks   |
| B     | 128.0.0.0 – 191.255.0.0| 255.255.0.0              | Medium networks  |
| C     | 192.0.0.0 – 223.255.255.0 | 255.255.255.0          | Small networks   |

---

## 📡 Unicast vs Multicast vs Broadcast

| Type     | Description                                |
|----------|--------------------------------------------|
| Unicast  | One-to-one communication                   |
| Multicast| One-to-many (selected group) communication |
| Broadcast| One-to-all devices on the network          |

## ✂️ Subnetting

**Subnetting** is dividing a large network into smaller logical subnetworks (subnets) to optimize performance and management.

### Benefits:
- Reduces congestion  
- Enhances security  
- Efficient IP usage  
- Simplifies troubleshooting  

---

## 🆔 MAC Address

A **MAC (Media Access Control) address** is a **48-bit** hardware identifier assigned to a network interface card (NIC) by the manufacturer.

### Key Features:
- Hard-coded in hardware (can be changed in software)
- Written in **hexadecimal** (e.g., `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`)
- Used for **local** (LAN) communication

---

## 🌍 DNS – Domain Name System

DNS translates **domain names** (like `youtube.com`) into **IP addresses** (`142.250.195.14`) that computers can understand.

### Why DNS is Needed:
- Humans remember names, not numbers.
- Computers use numbers (IP).
- DNS bridges the gap.

### How DNS Works:
1. User types `www.example.com`
2. Browser asks **DNS resolver** for the IP
3. Resolver queries:
   - 🧱 Root server
   - 🏛️ TLD server (`.com`, `.org`)
   - 🗂️ Authoritative server (holds domain info)
4. IP is returned and browser loads the site

---

## 🚪 Default Gateway

A **default gateway** is typically a **router** that connects your local network to the outside world (internet or other networks).

### Importance:
- Acts as a communication bridge
- Sends data outside the local network
- Without it, devices can’t access the internet
